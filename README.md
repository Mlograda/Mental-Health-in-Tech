# Mental-Health-in-Tech

In this project, I’m going to use data collected by Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) (https://osmihelp.org/). OSMI conducts yearly surveys that "aim to measure attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace and examine the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers." These surveys are accessible to the public for participation and can be found at https://osmihelp.org/research.
In this study, I’m going to learn about mental health in tech by covering the following:  

  •	Introducing the case study  
  •	Integrating the data sources  
  •	Cleaning the data  
  •	Analyzing the data  
  
**Introducing the case study**  

Mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression are inherently detrimental to people's well-being, lifestyles, and ability to be productive in their work. According to Mental Health America, over 44 million adults in the US have a mental health condition. The mental health of employees in the tech industry is of great concern due to the competitive environments often found within and among these companies. Some employees at these companies are forced to work overtime simply to keep their jobs. Managers of these types of companies have good reason to desire improved mental health for their employees because healthy minds are productive ones and distracted minds are not. Managers and leaders of tech and non-tech companies must make difficult decisions regarding whether or not to invest in the mental health of their employees and, if so, to what degree. There is plenty of evidence that poor mental health can have a negative impact on workers' well-being and productivity. Every company has a finite amount of funds that it can invest in the physical health of its employees, let alone mental health. Knowing where to allocate resources is of great importance.  

This analysis is intended for the managers and the leaders of tech companies who are in charge of making decisions that can impact the mental health of their employees.

**Analysis**  
Specifically for this analysis, I will try to answer the following **Analytic Questions**:  
  •	**AQ1**: AQ1: Is there a significant difference between the mental health of employees across the attribute of gender?  
  •	**AQ2**: Is there a significant difference between the mental health of employees across the attribute of age?   
  •	**AQ3**: Do more supportive companies have healthier employees mentally?  
  •	**AQ4**: Does the attitude of individuals toward mental health influence their mental health and their seeking of treatments?  
  
**Source of Data**  
OSMI started conducting the mental health in tech survey in 2014. To perform this analysis, the raw data for 2014 and 2016 to 2020 have been used. These data are accessible at https://osmihelp.org/research.
